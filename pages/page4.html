      <h1>THE CONDITIONAL</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>How to make the Conditional in English</h2>
      <li>
        Conditional tenses are used to speculate about what could happen, 
        what might have happened, and what we wish would happen. 
        In English, most sentences using the conditional contain the word if. 
        Many conditional forms in English are used in sentences that include verbs in one of the past tenses. 
        This usage is referred to as "the unreal past" because we use a past tense but we are not actually referring to something 
        that happened in the past. There are five main ways of constructing conditional sentences in English. In all cases, 
        these sentences are made up of an if clause and a main clause. In many negative conditional sentences, 
        there is an equivalent sentence construction using "unless" instead of "if".

      <h3>The zero conditional</h3>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li>The zero conditional is used for when the time being referred to 
            is now or always and the situation is real and possible. 
            The zero conditional is often used to refer to general truths. 
            The tense in both parts of the sentence is the simple present. 
            In zero conditional sentences, the word "if" can usually be replaced 
            by the word "when" without changing the meaning.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Type 1 conditional</h3>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li>The type 1 conditional is used to refer to the present or future 
            where the situation is real. The type 1 conditional refers to a possible 
            condition and its probable result. In these sentences the if clause 
            is in the simple present, and the main clause is in the simple future.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h3>Type 2 conditional</h3>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li>The type 2 conditional is used to refer to a time that is now or any time, 
            and a situation that is unreal. These sentences are not based on fact. 
            The type 2 conditional is used to refer to a hypothetical condition and its probable result. 
            In type 2 conditional sentences, the if clause uses the simple past, and the main clause uses 
            the present conditional.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h3>Type 3 conditional</h3>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li>The type 3 conditional is used to refer to a time that is in the past, 
            and a situation that is contrary to reality. The facts they are based 
            on are the opposite of what is expressed. The type 3 conditional is used 
            to refer to an unreal past condition and its probable past result. 
            In type 3 conditional sentences, the if clause uses the past perfect, 
            and the main clause uses the perfect conditional.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h3>Mixed conditional</h3>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li>The mixed type conditional is used to refer to a time that is in the past, 
            and a situation that is ongoing into the present. The facts they are based 
            on are the opposite of what is expressed. The mixed type conditional is used 
            to refer to an unreal past condition and its probable result in the present. 
            In mixed type conditional sentences, the if clause uses the past perfect, 
            and the main clause uses the present conditional.
